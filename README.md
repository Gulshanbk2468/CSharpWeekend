#PROJECT DESCRIPTION


A simple full-stack web application built using .NET Minimal API and SQL Server.
The project implements user registration, login authentication, session-based authorization, and role-based access control (Admin/User).

The admin user has access to an editable home page, while normal users can access a standard home page.

This project was developed entirely using VS Code and the .NET CLI (terminal) as a weekend learning project to understand backend development fundamentals.
