# CSharpWeekend
A simple full-stack web application built using ASP.NET Core and SQL Server. The project implements user registration, login authentication, session-based authorization, and an admin-only home page that displays a personalized greeting. Developed entirely using VS Code and terminal as a weekend learning project.
